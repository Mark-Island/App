# This Is Your App

This project contains an [AppFair](https://www.appfair.net) app,
which is a free, native, and secure application distribution platform
for pure SwiftUI applications. 

To get started building your own app:

1. Create a new GitHub Organization named *"Org-Name"*. This name will uniquely identify your app, and will be the basis of the app's "bundle ID". The name must contain only alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, and 0-9) and a single hyphen (-)
2. [Fork the appfair/App repository](https://github.com/appfair/App/fork) into your "Org-Name" organization. You can now check out your version of the app at https://github.com/appfair/App/fork is
3. [Edit Sources/App/App.swift](../../edit/main/Sources/App/App.swift) and add your code to the app.                                      
4. [Create a Pull Request](../../compare) with your changes.
5. [Watch the integration action](https://github.com/appfair/App/actions) for your app's build status.                                    
6. The successful build will become available for the AppFair's [Releases Page](https://github.com/appfair/App/releases).
7. Download, share and enjoy!
